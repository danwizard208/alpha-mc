compute-parameters.py
    Python script to compute the azimuth angle and height of the counter,
    based on its radius and the AV radius and thickness
alphacounter.geo
    Geometry file, specifications of event generating region;
    needs to be copied to RATDIR/data/geo/
    Parameters:
        r_max - maximum av radius
        r_min - minimum av radius
        theta_delta - maximum azimuth angle of detector,
                      usually generated by compute-parameters.py
generate_events.mac
    Rat macro to generate the events
    Parameters: 
        The particles generated, their energies,
        and the rates at which they are generated.
        Standard rat macro, edit as you see fit.
process_events.py
    Python script to read in generated events,
    and calculate which events have a trajectory lining up with the detector,
    and generate TRIM.DAT to pass to SRIM
    Parameters:
        AV_RADIUS       - maximum av radius
        AV_INNER_RADIUS - minimum av radius
        counter_radius  - the radius of the detector
TRIM.IN
    Two files, one for nitrogen and one for air, that TRIM uses to determine
    the properties of the medium through which the particles travel.
    TIN.EXE can be used to generate these (it will save the result as just
    TRIM.IN, you may want to keep a copy as TRIM.IN.air for air and 
    TRIM.IN.nitrogen for nitrogen), and the dialog is fairly self explanitory.
    For thickness, you want to use the distance from the counter to the av,
    as calculated by compute-parameters.py. You can make this change in the
    dialog, or directly in the TRIM.IN file if you can find it.


Note: The geometry parameters are generated by user input to compute-parameters,
then hardcoded into alphacounter.geo and process_events.py.
Make sure they are consistent. 
(Apologies for the hardcoding, I am working on something better)
